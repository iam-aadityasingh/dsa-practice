# Problem Description:
Given two binary strings a and b, return their sum as a binary string.

# Approach:
1. Convert both binary strings to decimal using int(a, 2) and int(b, 2).
2. Add the two decimal integers.
3. Convert the sum back to binary using bin(), and slice off the "0b" prefix using [2:].
4. Return the resulting binary string.

# Time Complexity:
O(n + m), where n and m are the lengths of the input strings.

# Space Complexity:
O(1), no extra space apart from conversion.
