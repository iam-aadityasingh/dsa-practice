# Problem Description:
Given an array nums and a value val, remove all instances of that value in-place and return the new length. Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

# Approach:
1. Use two pointers: one (i) to iterate over the array and another (index) to track where non-val elements should go.
2. Traverse the array. If the current element is not equal to val, copy it to the position indicated by the `index` pointer.
3. After the loop, the `index` pointer will indicate the new length of the array (the number of non-val elements).

# Time Complexity:
O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array.

# Space Complexity:
O(1), as we only use two pointers for in-place modifications.
