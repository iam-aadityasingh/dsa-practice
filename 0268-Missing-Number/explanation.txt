# Problem Description:
Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n], return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.

# Approach:
1. Use the formula for the sum of first n natural numbers: n * (n + 1) // 2.
2. This gives the expected total sum of numbers from 0 to n.
3. Then subtract the actual sum of the input array from this expected sum.
4. The difference will be the missing number.

# Time Complexity: 
O(n), due to sum(nums)

# Space Complexity: 
O(1), constant space

Example:
Input: nums = [3, 0, 1]
Expected sum = 3 * (3 + 1) // 2 = 6
Actual sum = 4
Missing number = 6 - 4 = 2
Output: 2
