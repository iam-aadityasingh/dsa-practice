Problem: [326. Power of Three](https://leetcode.com/problems/power-of-three/)

---

Description:
Given an integer n, return true if it is a power of three. Otherwise, return false.
An integer n is a power of three, if there exists an integer x such that n == 3x.

---

Approach:
- We start with 3ยน as the base.
- Then multiply with 3 till the number 'n' is reached or higher.
- As we know the condition when to stop, while loop is preferred.
- When the loop ends we check if the final ans is equal to the specified n or not.
- If its equal we return True else False.
- As this approach needs the ans to start with 3 to check the case for 3ยบ we use a if-statement at the start.

Time Complexity:
- O(log n)
Because there is a single loop running.

Space Complexity:
- O(1)
We are using a single variable to store the result.
