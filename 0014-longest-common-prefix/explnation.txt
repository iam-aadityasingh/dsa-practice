# Problem Description:
Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".

# Approach:
1. First, check if the input list is empty. If yes, return an empty string.
2. Take the shortest string in the array (since the longest possible prefix can't be longer than that).
3. Iterate through every string in the list:
   - While the current string does not start with the current prefix guess:
     - Remove the last character from the prefix guess.
     - If the prefix becomes empty, return "" (no common prefix).
4. Return the final prefix after comparing all strings.

This approach narrows down the prefix efficiently by shrinking it only when necessary.

# Time Complexity:
O(S), where S is the sum of all characters in all strings.  
In the worst case, each character in the shortest string might be compared multiple times.

# Space Complexity:
O(1), no extra space used apart from a few variables.
