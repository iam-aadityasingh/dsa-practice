# Problem Description:
We ask each rabbit how many other rabbits have the same color. The i-th rabbit's answer is stored in answers[i]. We need to calculate the minimum total number of rabbits in the forest based on these replies.

# Approach:
1. Use a Counter to track how many rabbits gave each answer.
2. If a rabbit says "x", they imply a group of (x + 1) rabbits of their color.
3. If multiple rabbits give the same answer, divide them into groups of size (x + 1).
4. If not enough rabbits to complete the last group, still count it as a full group.
5. Multiply the number of groups by group size and add to total.

# Time Complexity:
O(n), where n is the number of answers.

# Space Complexity:
O(n), for storing the frequency map of answers.
